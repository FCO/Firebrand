This is a test application for using EmberJS + EmberREST and Magpie. Mostly I
wanted to see if EmberJS would do what I wanted for working as a clean AJAX
driven front-end client for Magpie based applications. Answer: basically yes.

There are still a few bugs in this, but considering I was trying to translate
from Rails to Magpie that's to be expected.

All of the EmberJS/EmberREST code is stolen/based upon [this series of blog posts][1].
